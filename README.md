All three of these are python progams I've made during the last two years.

OOO.py can take a math problem, Ex: 4 * (3 + 6) / 18 and parse the symbols and solve it using order of operations.
Playfair.py creates a playfair cipher using a key and encrypts a message.
RSA.py is an example of RSA encryption using public key cryptography.
